<h2> 1. To all members: </h2>
  <p>To all team members, this project will be implemented using python3 and it's virtual environment (learn more about it <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/"
  target="_blank">here</a>). This is especially important since python is interpreted and requires libraries, and they will not be on the lab machine.</p>
  
<h2>2. How to work in this environment:</h2>
  <p>
    <li>Create your own branch.</li>
    <li>Do small things.</li>
    <li>When you done the small thing create a pull request (learn more <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>
    <li>DO NOT CHANGE THE MAIN BRANCH.</li>
    <li>Create pull requests after u finish small things. It is easier to check the code.</li>
  </p>
